abstract: Despite the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by lotic ecosystems, they are strongly affected by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, biological monitoring and assessment strategies are crucial in helping maintain these ecosystems and developing mitigation policies. We provide a global overview of the use of benthic diatoms as bioindicators in lotic environments, by analyzing 764 articles published in the past 20 years. We analyzed the influence of substrate type on samplings, which species have been highlighted as indicators and for which type of impacts, which anthropogenic impacts have been most commonly evaluated, and which metrics have been commonly used in studies using diatoms to assess and monitor the quality of lotic environments. We found that the most studied anthropogenic impact is artificial eutrophication and that some species, especially Nitzschia palea, have been thoroughly mentioned as indicators of this impact. Indicator species related to other types of impact are less common, demonstrating the need for studies on this issue. Moreover, we verified that traditional taxonomic metrics, such as diversity and diatom indices, have been widely used. Some alternative metrics have been used recently, such as those based on teratological valves, lipid bodies, valve size, and DNA metabarcoding. The number of biomonitoring and assessment studies based on diatoms has increased considerably
in the past 20 years. Nonetheless, the demand for natural resources and consequently the degradation of lotic ecosystems have accelerated significantly. Thus, the development of low-cost and time-efficient biological
assessment and monitoring strategies is essential for evaluating the health of lotic environments.
