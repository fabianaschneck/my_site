Dissertation title: Does invertebrates select periphytic diatoms from the biofilm?

#I am a biologist and Master’s student in [Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments at #FURG](https://ppgbac.furg.br/). I'm working with stream benthic macroinvertebrates and #specifically interested in understanding resource partitioning among scrapers with focus on #the consumption of diatoms that live in distinct layers of the periphytic biofilm. I want #to know whether scrapers have feeding preferences over diatoms and I'm going to quantify #resource partitioning by evaluating trophic niche overlap and width. I'm co-supervised by #[Edélti Faria Albertoni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edelti_Albertoni).
