Dissertation title: Potential distribution of Podostemaceae species in face of climate change

#I have a degree in Biology and currently I'm a Master's student at the Graduate Program in #Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments, supervised by Fabiana and co-supervised by #[Fabiana Barbosa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabiana_Barbosa4). I am working with #ecological niche modeling in order to assess how future climate change scenarios may affect #the potential distribution of Podostemaceae, a family of aquatic plants, in the Prata, #South Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic basins.
