I am a Biologist and Master in Freshwater Biology (Biologia de Ambientes Aqu√°ticos Continentais; 2008) at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG. In 2010, I joined FURG as a public employee (Administrative Technician in Education) at the Limnology Lab. In 2021 I entered at the PhD program in Freshwater Biology. I am interested in the spatial distribution of species, especially aquatic macrophyte metacommunities. I love cycling, traveling, drinking wine and poetry. I live in a farm and my dream is to plant a forest.
