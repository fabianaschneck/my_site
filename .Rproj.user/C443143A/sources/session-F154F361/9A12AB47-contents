My first contact with taxonomy of freshwater diatoms occurred when I was an undergrad. During my Masters in Botany, I focused on the taxonomy of diatoms from northwest Ceará, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Thelma Ludwig and co-supervision of Prof. Dr. Kaoli Cavalcante.

Currently, as a PhD student at PPGBAC, I intend to analyze the effects of multiple stressors on periphytic algal communities, as part of the ExStream Brazil experiment, coordinated by Prof. Dr. Ricardo Taniwaki (UFABC), my co-supervisor.
