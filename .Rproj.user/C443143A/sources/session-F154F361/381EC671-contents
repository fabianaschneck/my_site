I started my academic journey with a degree in Biology at Universidade Estadual de Maring치. During my undergrad, I was lucky to work at NUPELIA (one of the pioneering research groups in Limnology in Brazil), which has as its main study site the Upper Paran치 River floodplain. It was at that time when my interest in freshwater ecology and microalgae, specifically diatoms, began. 

In my Master's, I switched from studying the Upper Paran치 River Floodplain to start studying high-altitude streams in southern Brazil. I did my Masters in [Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments at FURG](https://ppgbac.furg.br/) working with Fabiana looking at the effects of grazers structuring stream benthic diatom communities.

As a PhD student in [Ecology at UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgecologia/), I'm working with [Adriano S. Melo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adriano_Melo2) and I am co-supervised by Fabiana. I am keenly interested in how the organization and resilience of communities is related to the spatial context of streams in dendritic networks.
