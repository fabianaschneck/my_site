I have a degree in Biology (FURG, 2016) and in 2019 I completed my Master's in which I studied beta diversity of phytoplankton communities in coastal shallow lakes. In the same year I started as a PhD student at the Graduate Program in Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments - FURG.

During my PhD, I'm evaluating whether diatom biomarkers, such as teratologies and lipid bodies, as well as linear and geometric morfometry, are goog indicators of stream conditions in Pampa biome (natural grassland).
