I am a Bachelor in Biological Sciences with emphasis on Marine and Coastal Environmental
Management. My interest in aquatic ecology and limnology, and especially in algae and their role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems began as an undergrad.
I did my Masters in Ecology at UFRGS analyzing how size variation in periphytic algae  influences the spatial and environmental structure of metacommunities in shalow coastal lakes.

Currently, as a PhD student at PPGBAC-FURG, I intend to investigate delayed responses of
benthic diatom communities to habitat change in streams of the Pampa Biome.
