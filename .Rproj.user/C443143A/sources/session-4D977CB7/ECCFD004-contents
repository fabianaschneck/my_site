I’m a Professor of Ecology at Instituto de Ciências Biológicas (Biological Sciences Institute) in Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG, Rio Grande, [southernmost Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/@-17.1615981,-49.927824,5863354m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=pt-BR&authuser=0). 

I’m interested in freshwater ecology since I was an undergrad back in 2001. At that time, I started to work at the Limnology Lab at [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/), where I also did my Masters on the effects of eutrophication on stream benthic diatoms. 

During my [PhD in Ecology at UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgecologia/) I worked with [Adriano S. Melo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adriano_Melo2) looking at the effects of habitat complexity, hydrological disturbances and grazers on structuring stream benthic algal communities.


My research focuses primarily on investigating biodiversity patterns in freshwater environments. I am also broadly interested in understanding how human-induced impacts affect aquatic communities. Even though most of my work uses benthic diatoms as a biological model, the research that I develop with my graduate students is not restricted to this group of organisms.

I'm a supervisor in the [Graduate Program in Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments](https://ppgbac.furg.br/) of FURG and I am fortunate to work with a talented group of young Brazilian scientists.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in knowing more about our work or about student admissions to Masters and PhD degrees at FURG.
