I have a degree in Ecology and Environmental Analysis and currently I am a PhD candidate in Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments (FURG), where I also completed my master's degree under the supervision of Fabiana.  

My experience in Freshwater Ecology began in 2011 during my undergraduate studies at Universidade Federal de Goiás where I worked with Dr. Sirlene Aparecida Felisberto and Dr. Priscilla de Carvalho investigating the ecology of periphytic algal communities. During my master’s degree, I investigated the effects of increased temperature and runoff on periphytic diatoms. 

During my PhD I'm supervised by [Luiz Ubiratan Hepp](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luiz_Hepp) and co-supervised by Fabiana, and my research aims to evaluate the impacts of land use and land cover on periphytic diatom communities and ecosystem services at different spatial scales in Pampa biome.
