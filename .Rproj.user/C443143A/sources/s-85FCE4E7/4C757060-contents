My first contact with taxonomy of freshwater diatoms was as an undergraduate student, when I worked with Dr. Kaoli Cavalcante at Universidade Estadual do Vale do Acaraú. During my Masters, I worked on the taxonomy and floristic surveys of diatoms at the northeastern region of Brazil, specifically in the northwestern region of Ceará State. I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Thelma Ludwig, and co-supervised by Dr. Kaoli Cavalcante. 

Now, as a PhD student at PPGBAC, I am planning to study the effects of multiple stressors on benthic microalgal communities.
