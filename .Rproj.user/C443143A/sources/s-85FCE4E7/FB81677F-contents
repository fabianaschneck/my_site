<font size="4">We are mainly interested in understanding <span style="color:#607CA0">**spatial and temporal patterns of freshwater biodiversity**</span> and underlying  <span style="color:#607CA0">**processes that determine the composition of biological communities**</span>, in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes.</font> 

Our research is focused in<font size="4"><span style="color:#607CA0"> **subtropical streams**</span> and, commonly, we use benthic diatom communities as a biological model to describe diversity patterns and test ecological hypotheses. Our studies also encompass stream insects, phytoplankton and macrophytes in lentic environments and mesocosm experiments.</font>
