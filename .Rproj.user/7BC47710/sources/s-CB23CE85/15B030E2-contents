I am a biologist graduated by FURG and currently I'm a Master's student in Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments. I am supervised by Fabiana and co-supervised by Dra. [Camila de Martinez Gaspar Martins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camila_Martins3).
My research focus on understanding the contamination of freshwaters by glyphosate affects on phytoplankton communities, evaluating changes in species richness and beta diversity and also testing the hypothesis of evolutionary rescue.
