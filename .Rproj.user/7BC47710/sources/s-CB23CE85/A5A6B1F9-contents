I have a degree in Biology and currently I'm a Master's student at the Graduate Program in Biology of Continental Aquatic Environments, supervised by Fabiana and co-supervised by [Fabiana Barbosa](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabiana_Barbosa4). I am working with ecological niche modeling in order to assess how future climate change scenarios may affect the potential distribution of Podostemaceae, a family of aquatic plants, in the Prata, South Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic basins.
