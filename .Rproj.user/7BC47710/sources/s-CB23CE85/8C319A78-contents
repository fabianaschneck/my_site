The metacommunity concept is the background of all our research within this topic. We investigate alpha and beta diversity patterns at both local and regional scales to disentangle the importance of local environmental variables, landscape features and dispersal in structuring freshwater communities. 

We are also particularly interested in understanding the importance of environmental selection and dispersal in shaping community organization in dendritic networks.
