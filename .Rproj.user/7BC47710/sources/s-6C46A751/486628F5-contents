I started my academic journey with a degree in Biology at Universidade Estadual de Maringá. During my undergrad, I was lucky to work at NUPELIA (one of the pioneering research groups in Limnology in Brazil), which has as its main study site the Upper Paraná River floodplain. It was as that time my interest in freshwater ecology and microalgae, specifically diatoms, began. 

In my Master's, I switched from studying the Upper Paraná River Floodplain to start studying high-altitude streams in southern Brazil. I did my Masters in [Freshwater Biology at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande – FURG](https://ppgbac.furg.br/) working with Fabiana Schneck looking at the effects of grazers structuring stream benthic diatom communities.

Now, as a PhD student in [Ecology at UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/ppgecologia/), I work with Adriano S. Melo and I am co-supervised by Fabiana Schneck. I am keenly interested in how the organization and resilience of communities is related to the spatial context of streams in dendritic networks.
